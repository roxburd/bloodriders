## Welcome to the Bloodriders Pages

### Privacy Overview
If you give the 'Contacts' permission, this app reads your name from your Google profile and your controller details from your address book. You can also enter your name and duty dates. All of this data is visible and editable on the Settings and Duties screens.

If you give the 'Location' permission, this app can read your precise location.

No other personal or sensitive data is read or held by this app.

The data is stored securely within the app and not communicated anywhere else except:

 1) to your SMS (text) app when you click 'OK' to send a message - at this point the data is submitted to your SMS (text) app as a draft message for you to edit, send or cancel as you please.
 
 2) if you have switched the Tracker on and it detects that your device has been stationary for a prolonged period and you have failed to respond to alerts - the Tracker will send your name and your device's precise location directly to the controller.

### The Tracker
The Tracker does not calculate your speed and only keeps your location data points for 5 minutes max - just long enough to work out if you're moving.

### Analytics
The app reports analytics data (pages viewed, problems, etc.) back to a central server for analysis. This data helps us understand how people use the app and how we can improve it. This data includes no personal data and cannot be attributed to individual users. This feature complies with Google's rules and regulations and our legal obligations under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### Privacy policy
We will keep your personal data safe and secure. The data will not be allowed outside of the app except in SMS (text) messages. Apart from the Tracker, whenever your data is allowed outside the app, it is displayed in your regular SMS (text) app where you can review and edit it and decide whether to send or not. If you choose to switch it on, the Tracker will send your name and location to the controller automatically if your device has been stationary for a prolonged period and you have failed to respond to alerts.
