## Welcome to the Bloodriders Pages

### Privacy overview
If you give the 'Contacts' permission, this app reads your name from your Google profile and your controller details from your address book. You can also enter your name and duty dates. All of this data is visible and editable on the Settings and Duties screens. If you give the 'Location' permission, this app can read your precise location. No other personal or sensitive data is read or held by this app. The data is stored securely within the app and not communicated anywhere else except to your text app when you click 'OK' to send a message - at this point the data is submitted to your text app as a draft message for you to edit, send or cancel as you please.

### Privacy policy
We will keep your data safe and secure. The data will not be allowed outside of the app except in SMS (text) messages which you get to review, edit and decide whether to send or not.
