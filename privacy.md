If you give permission, this app reads your name from your Google profile (or you can enter/edit it) and your controller details from your address book and you can enter your duty dates. All of this data is visible and editable on the Settings and Duties screens. No other personal or sensitive data is read or held by this app. The data is stored securely within the app and not communicated anywhere else except to your text app when you click 'OK' to send a message - at this point the data is submitted to your text app as a draft message for you to edit, send or cancel as you please.
