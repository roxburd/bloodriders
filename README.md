## Welcome to the Bloodriders Pages

An Android app for blood-bike riders (and drivers!) - those marvellous individuals who give up their own time to transport blood products to those in need.

The app gives you reminders to send your ready-for-duty message, automates your control messages and allows you to send your exact location to the controller.

It also offers a tracker, the use of which is optional - if you use the tracker it will send your precise location to the controller if you are unexpectedly stationary and fail to respond to alerts.

The future roadmap looks like this:
- support for other regions (different message formats, etc.)
 
Many thanks to our users and testers. Don't be shy - say Hi and give us your suggestions for future features.
