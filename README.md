## Welcome to the Bloodriders Pages

An Android app for blood-bike riders (and drivers!) - those marvellous individuals who give up their own time to transport blood products to those in need. Today, this app will just make your life a little bit easier but the plan is to add further features which will add to your safety as well as convenience.

Version 0.1 is live and the roadmap looks like this:
- duty reminders to remind you to send that READY message.
- send live location.
- auto-tracking, sending location if you stop moving.
- support for other regions (different message formats, etc.)
 
Many thanks to our users and testers. Don't be shy - say Hi and give us your suggestions for future features.
