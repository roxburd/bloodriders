## Welcome to the Bloodriders Pages

An Android app for blood-bike riders (and drivers!) - those marvellous individuals who give up their own time to transport blood products to those in need.

The app gives you reminders to send your ready-for-duty message, automates your control messages and allows you to send your exact location to the controller.

It also offers a tracker, the use of which is optional - if you use the tracker it will send your precise location to the controller if you are unexpectedly stationary and fail to respond to alerts.

The app currently includes profiles tailor-made for SERVSC (Suffolk/Cambridgeshire), SERVSC-AA (their Air Ambulance service) and the Severn Freewheelers in Gloucestershire. The use of profiles makes it easy to extend the app to support further groups round the country.
