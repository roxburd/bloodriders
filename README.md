## Welcome to the Bloodriders Pages

An Android app for blood-bike riders (and drivers!) - those marvellous individuals who give up their own time to transport blood products to those in need.

The app gives you reminders to send your ready-for-duty message, automates your control messages and allows you to send your exact location to the controller.

The roadmap looks like this:
- auto-tracking, sending location if you stop moving.
- support for other regions (different message formats, etc.)
 
Many thanks to our users and testers. Don't be shy - say Hi and give us your suggestions for future features.
