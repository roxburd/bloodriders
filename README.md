## Welcome to the Bloodriders Pages

An Android app for blood-bike riders (and drivers!) - those marvellous individuals who give up their own time to transport blood products to those in need.

The app currently includes profiles tailor-made for SERVSC (Suffolk/Cambridgeshire), SERVSC-AA (their Air Ambulance service), the Severn Freewheelers in Gloucestershire and Lincolnshire Emergency Blood Bikes Service. The use of profiles makes it easy to extend the app to support further groups round the country.
