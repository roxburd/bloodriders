## Welcome to the Bloodriders Pages

An Android app for blood-bike riders (and drivers!).

Version 0.1 is live and the roadmap looks like this:
- duty reminders to remind you to send that READY message.
- send live location
- auto-tracking, sending location if you stop moving.
 
Many thanks to our users and testers. Don't be shy - say Hi and give us your suggestions for future features.
