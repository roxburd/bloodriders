## Bloodriders Pages: Rider's Guide

The app is designed to make life simpler for bloodrunners without making extra work for controllers. In fact, controller's shouldn't be able to tell whether you're using the app or not.

The app provides a number of features which help bloodrunners:
- duty alarms remind bloodrunners to report for duty, with controller details and message all set up, ready to send.
- traffic alerts warn bloodrunners if there are works planned on the roads they will use during their duty.
- automatic generation of controller messages, saving time and effort and ensuring correct message format, including auto-timestamps, locations and distances travelled.
- a simple one-click SendLocation feature sends the bloodrunner's location on a zoomable, scrollable map direct to the controller.
- the Tracker tracks the bloodrunner's progress and automatically sends their location directly to the controller if they stop somewhere unexpected for a prolonged period and don't respond to alerts.
- the Tracker also calculates the distance travelled and adds it to the Home message (for profiles that require it).

With SendLocation and the Tracker, accuracy depends on your device but is often as good as 2 metres.

The app is quick and simple to try out. There is also zero lock-in - you can switch between using the app and using your regular SMS app, even in the middle of a run.
